# SMS-Message-Spam-Detector
A simple Flask App to classify messages as Ham/Spam using Python and Naive Bayes algorithm from Scikit Learn.
The dataset used for training the model was taken from [Susan Li's Repo](https://github.com/susanli2016/SMS-Message-Spam-Detector/blob/master/spam.csv). I removed few empty columns from the dataset and used it for training.
