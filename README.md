# SMS-Message-Spam-Detector
A simple Flask App to classify messages as Ham/Spam using Python and Naive Bayes algorithm from Scikit Learn.
The dataset used for training the model was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ucilml/sms-spam-collection-dataset). I removed few empty columns from the dataset and used it for training.
